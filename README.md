# Correcting-Illumina-data

It is assumed that the user has properly installed the error correction programs and has them listed in their PATH. For downloading and extracting the datasets and genome sequences the user will need to have installed wget, cat, gunzip, fastq-dump (part of the NCBI Toolkit), and perl for the shuffleSequences_fastq.pl script (from the Velvet package).
